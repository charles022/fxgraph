So I'm going to be sending data from a server to a client across the internet where both the server and the client side are going to be running rust. Now I'm going to be sending updates from a larger table on the server. So the server is going to have say 10,000 rows and the client is going to ask for the top rows from the server and I only want to be sending just those top 10 rows and I want it to move over to the clients as efficiently as possible. Now I know that technically I could do something like send it as binary as the the object itself. But I've also heard about Apache aero and Apache arrow flight now with Apache aero and Apache aero flight. I've heard that there's something about both machines sharing the same memory model or something like that, so it should be more efficient. Can you tell me how exactly that works? And if that means we can send requests like this for just the top xros from the server to the client? And is that what Apache arrow and Apache arrow flight were built for?

So how would it compare to if my client and server were both using polars and we were transferring the data using gRPC?
You said:
We're going to go with just grpc and our own implementation with polars because at this early stage in developments we know we're going to be using some other custom data structures and formats so we don't want to lock into the Apache arrow ecosystem just yet. The next portion of our project is going to be working on integrating this front end rust webassembly portion of the front of browser with a JavaScript portion to display our values, graphs, and a dashboard. But JavaScript and HTML CSS libraries what do you recommend as lightweight works well with our rust web assembly portion and a very visually appealing for dashboard. Ultimately, if you think we can make a modern professional visual interfaced without libraries, you would do that as well, but we do not want to rely on just the rust web assembly for the visual employ ment because it does tend to look too crude.
You said:
What libraries are available in Rust that we could display natively through our rust web assembly front end portion? I'm thinking things like basic bar graphs that display the graph updated to whatever is being filtered, but other than that aren't necessarily themselves interactive. Here we're looking for just basic graph types but with a really nice modern visually appealing polish on them. So I'm thinking things like the way seabourn is a library that puts a nice visual flare on top of the cruder matplotlib and python. We would want something similar where we could display a simple graph using just the rust web assembly front end, but it would still fit the visual flow of the site itself

We are considering using Apache Arrow for our table instead of Polars. Would Polars have things that make it faster and less error prone for things like filtering, inserting/deleting/copying/referencing data, etc? If we focused any one operation, would you be confident that we could do that thing faster and more efficiently with Arrow and manual coding rather than Polars, or vice versa?
